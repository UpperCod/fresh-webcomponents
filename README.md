# Fresh + Atomico webcomponents

This is an example of [Atomico webcomponents](https://github.com/atomicojs/atomico) taking advantage of Fresh's
support for Preact, thanks to the [@atomico/react](https://github.com/atomicojs/react) package things
magically work even with SSR

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

## Todo

1. [ ] esm.sh no resuelve correctamente el modulo @atomico/react, this does not associate the types
